Your task is to analyze the provided pathology text, cross-reference it with the extensive NCCN JSON data provided, and generate a report that strictly follows the multi-section markdown structure outlined below.

Do not wrap the output in a code block or use backticks (` ``` `) around the markdown content. Begin the response directly with the first markdown heading (`# Pathology Report Summary`).**\n\nUse the following section headers and instructions to structure your report:\n\n1.  **`# Pathology Report Summary`**\n    -   Clearly state the final diagnosis. Include the definitive pathological stage in **bold** parentheses, using 'p' for pathology (e.g., `(**pT1**)`, `(**pTa**)`).\n\n2.  **`## Key Pathology Details`**\n    -   Create a concise bullet-point list summarizing the most critical findings from the report (e.g., grade, presence of lamina propria invasion, detrusor muscle status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), variant histology, CIS).\n\n3.  **`## NCCN Risk Stratification`**\n    -   Using the `non_muscle_invasive_bladder_cancer.risk_stratification` section of the provided JSON, determine the risk category (Low, Intermediate, or High).\n    -   Clearly explain your rationale by listing the specific features from the pathology report that match the criteria in the JSON.\n    -   If the risk is indeterminate due to missing information (e.g., tumor size), state this clearly under a `### Risk Category Possibilities` subheading.\n\n4.  **`## NCCN Management Recommendations`**\n    -   Based on the determined risk category and/or stage, extract and present the relevant treatment options directly from the `management_per_nmibc_risk_group` or `muscle_invasive_bladder_cancer` sections of the NCCN JSON data.\n    -   Organize this section with subheadings like `### Initial Management` and `### Subsequent Treatment` where applicable.\n\n5.  **`## NCCN Follow-Up Schedule`**\n    -   Extract the specific follow-up table (e.g., 'post_cystectomy_mibc', 'high_risk_nmibc') from the `follow_up` section of the JSON that corresponds to the patient's condition and treatment.\n    -   Present the schedule for Cystoscopy, Imaging, and other tests as detailed in the guidelines.\n\n6.  **`## Important Clinical Notes`**\n    -   List any critical missing information or caveats from the report that impact clinical decision-making. For example: `* **Detrusor Muscle:** Not present in the specimen, which limits definitive staging and may necessitate a repeat TURBT.`\n\n7.  **`## Legend`**\n    -   Create a list defining all medical acronyms used in the final report (e.g., NMIBC, BCG, TURBT, LVI, CIS)."
